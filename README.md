# CIFAR-10 Image Classification With CNNs

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. Each class contains 6,000 images, making it a challenging task for image classification.

## Problem Definition

The primary goal of this project is to create a model capable of correctly classifying images into one of the 10 predefined classes. This task involves training a CNN to recognize patterns and features in the images and make accurate predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

**1. TensorFlow: For building and training deep learning models.**
**2. NumPy: For numerical operations.**
**3. Matplotlib: For data visualization.**

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is included with TensorFlow, eliminating the need for a separate download. The dataset consists of a training set with 50,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images, evenly distributed among the 10 classes.

## Model Building

In this project, we design a CNN architecture to handle image classification tasks. The model consists of convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and a softmax output layer. The model is optimized using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Training the Model

The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 training dataset. The training process involves iteratively updating the model's weights and biases to minimize the loss function. We monitor the training progress, including accuracy and loss metrics.

## Final Prediction

After training, we evaluate the model's performance on the CIFAR-10 test dataset to assess its ability to generalize to unseen data. We visualize and analyze the model's predictions compared to the true labels.
